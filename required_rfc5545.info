3.3.5.  Date-Time

   Value Name:  DATE-TIME

   Purpose:  This value type is used to identify values that specify a
      precise calendar date and time of day.
      
   Format Definition:  This value type is defined by the following
      notation:

       date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified in the DATE and TIME
                                  ;value definitions

   Description:  If the property permits, multiple "DATE-TIME" values
      are specified as a COMMA-separated list of values.  No additional
      content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding, see
      Section 3.3.11) is defined for this value type.

      The "DATE-TIME" value type is used to identify values that contain
      a precise calendar date and time of day.  The format is based on
      the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, basic format for a
      calendar date and time of day.  The text format is a concatenation
      of the "date", followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character,
      the time designator, followed by the "time" format.

      The "DATE-TIME" value type expresses time values in three forms:

      The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For
      example, the following is not valid for a DATE-TIME value:

       19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format

      FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME

      The date with local time form is simply a DATE-TIME value that
      does not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time
      zone.  For example, the following represents January 18, 1998, at
      11 PM:

       19980118T230000

      DATE-TIME values of this type are said to be "floating" and are
      not bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to
      represent the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of
      which time zone is currently being observed.  For example, an
      event can be defined that indicates that an individual will be
      busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone
      the person is in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.
      The recipient of an iCalendar object with a property value
      consisting of a local time, without any relative time zone
      information, SHOULD interpret the value as being fixed to whatever
      time zone the "ATTENDEE" is in at any given moment.  This means
      that two "Attendees", in different time zones, receiving the same
      event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
            event at different actual times.  Floating time SHOULD only be
      used where that is the reasonable behavior.

      In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
      fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
      time zone reference MUST be specified.

      The use of local time in a DATE-TIME value without the "TZID"
      property parameter is to be interpreted as floating time,
      regardless of the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in
      the iCalendar object.

      FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME

      The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
      CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character, the UTC designator, appended to
      the time value.  For example, the following represents January 19,
      1998, at 0700 UTC:

       19980119T070000Z

      The "TZID" property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME
      properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

      FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

      The date and local time with reference to time zone information is
      identified by the use the "TZID" property parameter to reference
      the appropriate time zone definition.  "TZID" is discussed in
      detail in Section 3.2.19.  For example, the following represents
      2:00 A.M. in New York on January 19, 1998:

       TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000

      If, based on the definition of the referenced time zone, the local
      time described occurs more than once (when changing from daylight
      to standard time), the DATE-TIME value refers to the first
      occurrence of the referenced time.  Thus, TZID=America/
      New_York:20071104T013000 indicates November 4, 2007 at 1:30 A.M.
      EDT (UTC-04:00).  If the local time described does not occur (when
      changing from standard to daylight time), the DATE-TIME value is
      interpreted using the UTC offset before the gap in local times.
      Thus, TZID=America/New_York:20070311T023000 indicates March 11,
      2007 at 3:30 A.M. EDT (UTC-04:00), one hour after 1:30 A.M. EST
      (UTC-05:00).
      A time value MUST only specify the second 60 when specifying a
      positive leap second.  For example:

       19970630T235960Z

      Implementations that do not support leap seconds SHOULD interpret
      the second 60 as equivalent to the second 59.

   Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
      York City in each of the three time formats, using the "DTSTART"
      property.

       DTSTART:19970714T133000                   ; Local time
       DTSTART:19970714T173000Z                  ; UTC time
       DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19970714T133000
                                                 ; Local time and time
                                                 ; zone reference

3.6.1.  Event Component

   Component Name:  VEVENT

   Purpose:  Provide a grouping of component properties that describe an
      event.

   Format Definition:  A "VEVENT" calendar component is defined by the
      following notation:

       eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF
                    eventprop *alarmc
                    "END" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF

       eventprop  = *(
                  ;
                  ; The following are REQUIRED,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                  ;
                  dtstamp / uid /
                  ;
                  ; The following is REQUIRED if the component
                  ; appears in an iCalendar object that doesn't
                  ; specify the "METHOD" property; otherwise, it
                  ; is OPTIONAL; in any case, it MUST NOT occur
                  ; more than once.
                  ;
                  dtstart /
                  ;
                  ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.

                  ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                  ; but SHOULD NOT occur more than once.

                  ; a 'eventprop', but 'dtend' and 'duration'
                  ; MUST NOT occur in the same 'eventprop'.
                  ;
                  dtend / duration /
                  ;
                  ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                  ; and MAY occur more than once.

                  ;
                  )

   Description:  A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties, possibly including "VALARM" calendar
      components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a
      calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour
      long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow.
      Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar.
      Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for
      busy time.  Alternately, the event can have its Time Transparency
      set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the event in
      searches for busy time.

      The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
      anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.  These events
      have a DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the
      default value type of DATE-TIME.  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND"
      property, it MUST be specified as a DATE value also.  The
      anniversary type of "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e.,
      "DTEND" property value is set to a calendar date after the
      "DTSTART" property value).  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DURATION"
      property, it MUST be specified as a "dur-day" or "dur-week" value.

      The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive
      start of the event.  For recurring events, it also specifies the
      very first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTEND" property
      for a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end
      of the event.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
      specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE value type but no
      "DTEND" nor "DURATION" property, the event's duration is taken to
      be one day.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
      specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME value type but no
      "DTEND" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and
      time of day specified by the "DTSTART" property.

      The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
      related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
      component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
      searches for busy time:

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART:19970903T163000Z
       DTEND:19970903T190000Z
       SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
       CLASS:PRIVATE
       CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
      transparent, to searches for busy time:
      BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART:19970401T163000Z
       DTEND:19970402T010000Z
       SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
       CLASS:PUBLIC
       CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent an anniversary that will occur annually:

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:19971102
       SUMMARY:Our Blissful Anniversary
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       CLASS:CONFIDENTIAL
       CATEGORIES:ANNIVERSARY,PERSONAL,SPECIAL OCCASION
       RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY
       END:VEVENT

      The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
      used to represent a multi-day event scheduled from June 28th, 2007
      to July 8th, 2007 inclusively.  Note that the "DTEND" property is
      set to July 9th, 2007, since the "DTEND" property specifies the
      non-inclusive end of the event.

       BEGIN:VEVENT
       UID:20070423T123432Z-541111@example.com
       DTSTAMP:20070423T123432Z
       DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20070628
       DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20070709
       SUMMARY:Festival International de Jazz de Montreal
       TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
       END:VEVENT

3.8.1.6.  Geographic Position

   Property Name:  GEO

   Purpose:  This property specifies information related to the global
      position for the activity specified by a calendar component.
   
   Value Type:  FLOAT.  The value MUST be two SEMICOLON-separated FLOAT
      values.

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
      calendar components.

   Description:  This property value specifies latitude and longitude,
      in that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering).  The longitude
      represents the location east or west of the prime meridian as a
      positive or negative real number, respectively.  The longitude and
      latitude values MAY be specified up to six decimal places, which
      will allow for accuracy to within one meter of geographical
      position.  Receiving applications MUST accept values of this
      precision and MAY truncate values of greater precision.

      Values for latitude and longitude shall be expressed as decimal
      fractions of degrees.  Whole degrees of latitude shall be
      represented by a two-digit decimal number ranging from 0 through
      90.  Whole degrees of longitude shall be represented by a decimal
      number ranging from 0 through 180.  When a decimal fraction of a
      degree is specified, it shall be separated from the whole number
      of degrees by a decimal point.

      Latitudes north of the equator shall be specified by a plus sign
      (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
      designating degrees.  Latitudes south of the Equator shall be
      designated by a minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the Equator shall be assigned to the Northern
      Hemisphere.

      Longitudes east of the prime meridian shall be specified by a plus
      sign (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the
      digits designating degrees.  Longitudes west of the meridian shall
      be designated by minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
      degrees.  A point on the prime meridian shall be assigned to the
      Eastern Hemisphere.  A point on the 180th meridian shall be
      assigned to the Western Hemisphere.  One exception to this last
      convention is permitted.  For the special condition of describing
      a band of latitude around the earth, the East Bounding Coordinate
      data element shall be assigned the value +180 (180) degrees.

      Any spatial address with a latitude of +90 (90) or -90 degrees
      will specify the position at the North or South Pole,
      respectively.  The component for longitude may have any legal
      value.
      
      With the exception of the special condition described above, this
      form is specified in [ANSI INCITS 61-1986].

      The simple formula for converting degrees-minutes-seconds into
      decimal degrees is:

      decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

       geo        = "GEO" geoparam ":" geovalue CRLF

       geoparam   = *(";" other-param)

       geovalue   = float ";" float
       ;Latitude and Longitude components

3.8.2.2.  Date-Time End

   Property Name:  DTEND

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that a calendar
      component ends.

   Value Type:  The default value type is DATE-TIME.  The value type can
      be set to a DATE value type.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type, and time
      zone identifier property parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in "VEVENT" or
      "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description:  Within the "VEVENT" calendar component, this property
      defines the date and time by which the event ends.  The value type
      of this property MUST be the same as the "DTSTART" property, and
      its value MUST be later in time than the value of the "DTSTART"
      property.  Furthermore, this property MUST be specified as a date
      with local time if and only if the "DTSTART" property is also
      specified as a date with local time.

      Within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, this property defines
      the end date and time for the free or busy time information.  The
      time MUST be specified in the UTC time format.  The value MUST be
      later in time than the value of the "DTSTART" property.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:
      
       dtend      = "DTEND" dtendparam ":" dtendval CRLF

       dtendparam = *(
                  ;

       DTEND;VALUE=DATE:19980704

3.8.2.4.  Date-Time Start

   Property Name:  DTSTART

   Purpose:  This property specifies when the calendar component begins.

   Value Type:  The default value type is DATE-TIME.  The time value
      MUST be one of the forms defined for the DATE-TIME value type.
      The value type can be set to a DATE value type.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, value data type, and time
      zone identifier property parameters can be specified on this
